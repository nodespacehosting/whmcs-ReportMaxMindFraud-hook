# Whmcs ReportMaxMindFraud Hook

This is a WHMCS hook that will report fraud orders to MaxMind. Whether or not it still works is unknown.

We (NodeSpace Hosting) found this hook in a WHMCS installation from an aquisition we made. When we updated WHMCS to version 8.6 and switched to PHP 8.1, this hook threw errors.

The origins of this hook are unknown other than originally authored by Commercial Network Services. Further, we know it's licensed under the GPL, but unknown which version so we cannot provide an accurate copy of the GNU GPL with this hook.

If CNS reaches out to us or someone does happen to know more about this hook, we can update it accordingly.
